["what-is-statistics.html", "1.1 What is statistics?", " 1.1 What is statistics? Statistics is the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation and presentation of data. In applying statistics to a scientific, industrial, or social problem, it is conventional to begin with a statistical population. Populations can be diverse groups of people or objects such as “all people living in a country”. Statistics deals with every aspect of data, including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of surveys and experiments. "],

In social research (political science, sociology, psychology or economics), statistical methods are used to find answers to research questions or to test research hypotheses. Statistics is a basic research tool for social scientists. Statistics and related disciplines such as Data Science or Machine Learning allow us to better understand modern technologies (such as Computational photography, Google’s Spam Filter, Self-driving cars) that not only make our lives easier, but also have an impact on politics and current society (e.g. the so-called microtargeting 1 - it “is a form of targeting that uses recent technological developments to gather large amounts of online data. The data from people’s digital footprint’s analyzed to create and convey messages that reflect an individual’s preferences and personality” (Wikipedia). Microtargeting (via social media like Facebook) can be used e.g. in election campaigns. Zob. np.

["review-of-some-mathematical-concepts-used-in-statistics-and-data-science.html", "1.3 Review of some mathematical concepts used in statistics and data science", " 1.3 Review of some mathematical concepts used in statistics and data science 1.3.1 Algebra review - some basic rules 1.3.1.1 Identity There are equalities of two different types: equations and identities. An equality \\(=\\) is not the same as identity \\(\\equiv\\). The \\(\\equiv\\) symbol originally meant “is identically equal to”. An identity is a type of equality which is true for all values, e.g.: \\((a+b)^2 \\equiv a^2+2ab+b^2.\\) 1.3.1.2 Differences - Delta notation The Greek letter \\(\\Delta\\) (capital delta) is the symbol used to indicate the difference in a measured quantity, usually at two different times. 1.3.1.3 Summation - Sigma notation In physics there are often contexts in which it’s necessary to add several quantities. A useful abbreviation for representing such a sum is the Greek letter \\(\\Sigma\\) (capital sigma). Suppose we wish to add a set of five numbers represented by \\(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5\\). In the abbreviated notation, we would write the sum as \\(x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5 = \\sum_{i=1}^{5} x_i\\) where the subscript i on x represents any one of the numbers in the set. For example, if there are five masses in a system, \\(m1, m2, m3, m4, m5\\), the total mass of the system \\(M = m1 + m2 + m3 + m4 + m5\\) could be expressed as \\(M = \\sum_{i=1}^{5} m_i\\) 1.3.1.4 Absolute value The magnitude of a quantity x, written x, is simply the absolute value of that quantity. The sign of x is always positive, regardless of the sign of x. For example, if x = -5, then |x| = 5; if x = 8, then |x| = 8. 1.3.1.5 Basic algebraic operations When algebraic operations are performed, the laws of arithmetic apply. Symbols such as x, y, and z are usually used to represent unspecified quantities, called the unknowns (or variables). First, consider the equation \\(8x = 32\\) If we wish to solve for x, we can divide (or multiply) each side of the equation by the same factor without destroying the equality. In this case, if we divide both sides by 8, we have \\(\\frac{8x}{8} = \\frac{32}{8}\\) \\(x = 4\\) Also, consider the equation \\(x + 2 = 8\\) In this type of expression, we can add or subtract the same quantity from each side. If we subtract 2 from each side, we have \\(x + 2 - 2 = 8 - 2\\) \\(x = 6\\) Now, consider the equation \\(\\frac{x}{5} = 9\\) If we multiply each side by 5, \\((\\frac{x}{5}) \\times 5 = 9 \\times 5\\) \\(x = 45\\) In all cases, whatever operation is performed on the left side of the equality must also be performed on the right side. 1.3.1.6 Some useful arithmetic rules Należy przypomnieć następujące zasady mnożenia, dzielenia, dodawania i odejmowania ułamków, gdzie a, b, c i d to cztery liczby: Rule Example Multiplying \\((\\frac{a}{b})(\\frac{c}{d}) = \\frac{ac}{bd}\\) Dividing \\((\\frac{a/b}{c/d}) = \\frac{ad}{bc}\\) Adding \\((\\frac{a}{b}) \\pm (\\frac{c}{d}) = \\frac{ad \\pm bc}{bd}\\) 1.3.1.7 Powers The following rules apply: \\(x^nx^m = x^{n+m}\\) \\(\\frac{x^n}{x^m} = x^{n-m}\\) \\(x^{\\frac{1}{n}} = \\sqrt[n]{x}\\) \\((x^n)^m = x^{nm}\\) 1.3.1.8 Logarithms Suppose a quantity x is expressed as a power of some quantity a: \\(x = a^y\\) The number a is called the base number. The logarithm of x with respect to the base a is equal to the exponent to which the base must be raised to satisfy the expression \\(x = a^y\\): \\(y = \\log_a x\\) In practice, the two bases most often used are base 10, called the common logarithm base, and base \\(e = 2.718 282\\), called Euler’s constant or the natural logarithm base. For any base: \\(\\log{(ab)} = \\log a + \\log b\\) \\(\\log{a/b} = \\log a + \\log b\\) \\(\\log{a^n} = n \\log a\\) Also, \\(\\ln e\\) \\(\\ln e^a = a\\) \\(\\ln(1/a) = -\\ln a\\) 1.3.1.9 Factoring Some useful formulas for factoring an equation are the following: \\(ax + ay + az = a(x + y + z)\\) \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = (a + b)^2\\) - so called “perfect square” \\(a^2 + b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)\\) 1.3.1.10 Linear equations A linear equation has the general form \\(y = mx + b\\) where m and b are constants. This equation is referred to as linear because the graph of y versus x is a straight line. The constant b, called the y-intercept, represents the value of y at which the straight line intersects the y axis. The constant m is equal to the slope of the straight line. If any two points on the straight line are specified by the coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), the slope of the straight line can be expressed as \\(Slope = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \\frac{\\Delta{y}}{\\Delta{x}}\\) Note that m and b can have either positive or negative values. If \\(m &gt; 0\\), the straight line has a positive slope. If \\(m &lt; 0\\), the straight line has a negative slope. Solving Simultaneous Linear Equations Consider the equation \\(3x + 5y = 15\\), which has two unknowns, x and y. Such an equation does not have a unique solution. For example, \\((x = 0, y = 3)\\), \\((x = 5, y = 0)\\), and (\\(x = 2, y = \\frac{9}{5}\\)) are all solutions to this equation. If a problem has two unknowns (variables), a unique solution is possible only if we have two equations. In general, if a problem has n unknowns, its solution requires n equations. To solve two simultaneous equations involving two unknowns, x and y, we solve one of the equations for x in terms of y and substitute this expression into the other equation. 1.3.2 Functions A function from a set A to another set B is an assignment of some element of B to each element in A. A function is a rule that assigns each input exactly one output. We call the output the image of the input. The set of all inputs for a function is called the domain. The set of all allowable outputs is called the codomain. In mathematics, a function is a binary relation between two sets that associates every element of the first set to exactly one element of the second set. Figure 1.1. Function Figure 1.2. Function A mathematical model is an abstract concept through which we use mathematical language and notation to describe a phenomenon in the world around us. Models describe our beliefs about how the world functions. In mathematical modelling, we translate those beliefs into the language of mathematics. A function can serve as a simple kind of mathematical model. Remember that a function is just a rule, f, that expresses the dependency of one variable quantity, y, on another variable quantity, x. We can think of the rule (given as a graph, a formula, or a table of values) as a representation of some natural cause and effect relationship – if x, then y – between the two variable quantities. For a mathematical model, we often seek an algebraic formula that captures observed behavior accurately and can be used to predict behavior not yet observed. 1.3.3 Sets Sets are denoted using curly braces \\(\\{\\}\\). e.g. \\(A = \\{0, 1\\}\\) 1.3.3.1 Set Definitions A set is a well-defined collection of objects. Each object in a set is called an element of the set. Two sets are equal if they have exactly the same elements in them. A set that contains no elements is called a null set or an empty set. If every element in Set A is also in Set B, then Set A is a subset of Set B. Membership: If \\(a\\) is a member of a set A, we write \\(a \\in A\\) Sets of numbers: set of natural numbers \\(N = \\{0, 1, 2, 3, ... \\}\\), set of positive natural numbers \\(N^+ = \\{1, 2, 3, ... \\}\\), a set of integers \\(Z = \\{..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ... \\}\\), a set of rational numbers \\(Q\\), i.e. all numbers that can be represented as \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\) for \\(q \\neq 0\\), set of irrational numbers \\(NQ\\), i.e. all numbers that have infinite and non-periodic decimal expansion, e.g. number \\(\\pi \\approx 3,141592...\\), or a number indicated by a letter \\(e \\approx 2,718 ...\\), set of real numbers \\(R = Q + NQ\\). \\(R\\) can be expressed as an interval \\((-\\infty, \\infty)\\). An interval is a set of real numbers with the property that any number that lies between two numbers in the set is also included in the set. The interval of numbers between a and b, including a and b, is often denoted \\([a, b]\\). The two numbers are called the endpoints of the interval. A singleton is a set with exactly one element. CAUTION: Be sure you understand the difference between the outcome -8 and the event {−8}, which is the set consisting of the single outcome −8. The cardinality (or size) of a collection or set \\(A\\), denoted \\(|A|\\), is the number of elements of the collection. This number may be finite or infinite. A finite set is a set that has a finite number of elements. In other words, it is either an empty set, a singleton, or a set whose elements can be listed in the form \\({a1, a2, . . . , an}\\) for some \\(n \\in N\\). A set that is not finite is called infinite. These sets have more than \\(n\\) elements for any integer \\(n\\). Whether finite or infinite, the elements of a countable set can always be counted one at a time and, although the counting may never finish, every element of the set is associated with a natural number. Countable sets form the foundation of a branch of mathematics called discrete mathematics. A set that is not countable is called uncountable set (or uncountably infinite set). It contains too many elements to be countable, e.g. an interval with positive length: \\([0, 1]\\). Table 1.1. The terminology of set theory and probability theory Set Theory Probability Theory Set Event Universal set Sample space Element Outcome Table 1.2. Probability event language - Event language \\(A\\) A occurs \\(A^c\\) A does not occur \\(A \\cup B\\) Either A or B occur \\(A \\cap B\\) Both A and B occur The difference between countable and uncountable sets is important for statistics and probability. Because of the mathematics required to determine probabilities, probabilistic methods are divided into two distinct types, discrete and continuous. A discrete approach is used when the number of experimental outcomes is finite (or infinite but countable). A continuous approach is used when the outcomes are continuous (and therefore infinite). It will be important to keep in mind which case is under consideration since otherwise, certain paradoxes may result. 1.3.4 Three basic concepts of calculus Limit of function; Derivative; Integral. 1.3.5 Limits In mathematics, a limit is the value that a function (or sequence) “approaches” as the input (or index) “approaches” some value. Limits are essential to calculus and mathematical analysis, and are used to define e.g. derivatives, and integrals. For \\(f(x)\\), we have \\[\\lim_{x \\rightarrow c}f(x)=L\\] For example, \\[\\lim_{x \\rightarrow 0}\\frac{1}{x}=\\infty\\] or, \\[\\lim_{x \\rightarrow \\infty}\\frac{1}{x}=0\\] In formulas, a limit of a function is usually written as \\[\\lim_{x \\to c}f(x)=L\\] and is read as “the limit of f of x as x approaches c equals L”. The fact that a function f approaches the limit L as x approaches c is usually denoted by a right arrow \\(\\to\\), as in: \\[f(x)\\to L{\\text{ as }}x\\to c\\] which reads \\(f(x)\\) tends to \\(L\\) as \\(x\\) tends to \\(c\\). Figure 1.3. Limits 1.3.6 Derivative First, a function must be specified that relates one variable to another (e.g., a coordinate as a function of time). Suppose one of the variables is called y (the dependent variable), and the other x (the independent variable). We might have a function relationship such as \\(y(x) = ax^2 + bx + c\\) If a, b, and c are specified constants, y can be calculated for any value of x. We usually deal with continuous functions, that is, those for which y varies “smoothly” with x. The derivative of y with respect to x is defined as the limit as \\(\\Delta x\\) approaches zero of the slopes of chords drawn between two points on the y versus x curve. Mathematically, we write this definition as \\[\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\lim_{\\Delta x \\to\\ 0} \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x} = \\lim_{\\Delta x \\to\\ 0} \\frac{y(x + \\Delta x) - y(x)}{\\Delta x}\\] where \\(\\Delta y = y_2 - y_1\\) and \\(\\Delta x = x_2 - x_1\\). Note that \\(dy/dx\\) does not mean \\(dy\\) divided by \\(dx\\), but rather is simply a notation of the limiting process of the derivative (differentiation operator). A useful expression to remember when \\(y = ax^n\\), where a is a constant and n is any positive or negative number (integer or fraction), is \\(\\frac{dy}{dx} = nax^{n-1}\\) Figure 1.4. Derivative - visual representation 1.3.7 Integral We think of integration as the inverse of differentiation. As an example, consider the expression 1.1 \\(f(x) = \\frac{dy}{dx} = 3ax^2 + b\\) which was the result of differentiating the function 1.2 \\(y(x) = ax^3 = bx + c\\) We can write equation 1.1 as \\(dy = f(x)dx = (3ax^2 + b)dx\\) and obtain \\(y(x)\\) by “summing” over all values of x. Mathematically, we write this inverse operation as \\[y(x) = \\int f(x) dx\\] \\[ y(x) = \\int (3az^2 + b)dx = ax^3 + bx + c\\] where c is a constant of the integration. This type of integral is called an indefinite integral because its value depends on the choice of c. 1.3.8 Integral as an area - intuitive explanation For a general continuous function f(x), the integral can be described as the area under the curve bounded by f(x) and the x axis, between two specified values of x, say, \\(x1\\) and \\(x2\\), as in the Figure 1.5. The area of the blue element in Figure 1.5 is approximately \\(f(x_i) \\Delta x_i\\). If we sum all these area elements between \\(x1\\) and \\(x2\\) and take the limit of this sum as \\(\\Delta x_i \\to 0\\), we obtain the true area under the curve bounded by f(x) and the x axis, between the limits \\(x1\\) and \\(x2\\): \\[Area = \\lim_{\\Delta x_i \\to\\ 0} \\sum_i f(x_i)\\Delta x_i = \\int_{x_1}^{x_2} f(x)dx\\] Integrals of this type are called definite integrals.
